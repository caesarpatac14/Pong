CMSC 22 MP4 : Pong

==========================================================================================================================================
Game Overview:

  Pong Game is basically a mini-tennis game. The objective of this game is to prevent the ball from touching your base. If the ball touches your base, your opponent's score will increment by 1. On the other hand, if the ball touches your opponent's base, your score will increase by 1. The ball gets faster every turn and will not stop moving until one of the players will reach the score of 3.
  
  The features of the game are pretty simple. Each of the players is required to enter their name. Also, each player has exactly 1 power up, so use it wisely. If one of the players will reach the score of 3, a window will pop up. It contains the winner of the game and the option to restart or not. If "Yes" is clicked, of course, the game will restart, with the same players. On the other hand, if you click "No", the game will end.
